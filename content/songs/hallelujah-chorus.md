# About This Piece

The "Hallelujah Chorus" is the culmination of Part II of George Frideric Handel's oratorio *Messiah*. Composed in 1741, it has become one of the most famous and frequently performed pieces in the Western choral canon.

## Historical Context

Legend has it that King George II was so moved when he first heard the "Hallelujah Chorus" that he stood up, and the tradition of standing during its performance has continued in many places ever since.

The piece is traditionally performed at Christmas, though *Messiah* was actually written for Easter and premiered in Dublin in 1742.

## Musical Features

- **Tempo**: Allegro moderato (♩ = 108-120)
- **Key**: D major
- **Duration**: Approximately 4 minutes
- **Voicing**: SATB with orchestral accompaniment (or organ/piano reduction)

The chorus features:
- Dramatic dynamic contrasts
- Antiphonal (call-and-response) textures
- Extended melismatic passages on "Hallelujah"
- Powerful homophonic climaxes
- Imitative counterpoint between voice parts

## Performance Notes

### Technical Challenges
1. **Breathing**: Plan your breathing carefully in the opening "Hallelujah" sequences
2. **Articulation**: Keep the dotted rhythms crisp and energetic
3. **Dynamics**: Strong contrasts between forte and piano sections
4. **Blend**: Balance between parts, especially when different parts have the melody

### Interpretation Tips
- Maintain energy and excitement throughout
- Watch the conductor carefully for tempo changes
- In the "King of Kings" section, give each entry clarity and purpose
- The final "Hallelujah" should be triumphant but not rushed

## Text

*Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!*
*For the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.*
*The kingdom of this world is become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.*
*And He shall reign for ever and ever.*
*King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.*
