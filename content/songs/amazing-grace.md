*'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,*
*And grace my fears relieved;*
*How precious did that grace appear*
*The hour I first believed.*

*Through many dangers, toils and snares,*
*I have already come;*
*'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,*
*And grace will lead me home.*

*The Lord has promised good to me,*
*His Word my hope secures;*
*He will my Shield and Portion be,*
*As long as life endures.*
